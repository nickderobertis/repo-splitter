Welcome to Repo Splitter documentation!
*********************************************

This is a Python and CLI tool for splitting repos. If you have a part of a repo which
you would now like to be a separate repo, and you would like to separate the history
of the two repos such that the new repo contains commits referencing its files and
any references to those files in the old repo have been removed, then this is
the tool for you.

To get started, look here.
